# Library Project - The Odin Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course. It's a simple library application that allows users to keep track of books they've read or want to read.

## What I've Implemented

In this project, I've created a web application with the following features:

1. A clean and responsive user interface for managing a book collection.
2. Functionality to add new books to the library:
   - Users can input the book's title, author, number of pages, and whether they've read it or not.
   - This is done through a modal dialog that appears when clicking the "Add Book" button.
3. Display of books in a visually appealing grid layout:
   - Each book is represented by a card showing its details.
4. Ability to remove books from the library:
   - Each book card has a "Delete" button to remove the book from the collection.
5. Option to toggle the read status of each book:
   - Users can mark a book as read or unread by clicking the "Toggle Read Status" button on each book card.
6. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. To add a new book:
   - Click the "Add Book" button in the header.
   - Fill out the form with the book's details.
   - Click "Add Book" to save it to your library.
4. To toggle a book's read status, click the "Toggle Read Status" button on the book card.
5. To remove a book from your library, click the "Delete" button on the book card.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the application.
- `script.js`: Includes the JavaScript code for handling user interactions and managing the book library.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I've practiced and demonstrated skills in:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Creating and using JavaScript objects and object constructors
- Implementing a responsive design with CSS
- Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
